# Automated bidding for Hattrick football manager
Project date: 2011

Hattrick is an Online football manager in which you can buy players through an auction process. The deadline for the auction extends 5 minutes into the future everytime someone makes a new bid. 

I made a desktop client that automated the bidding process without me having to be online.
